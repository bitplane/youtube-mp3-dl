So my dad got an MP3 player for Christmas, and he only ever
listened to music on YouTube. But we didn't know that.

Thankfully he runs Ubuntu. So I made these scripts for him
to download and convert an URL to mp3 using youtube-dl

todo: There's a script that gets the current tab from firefox
and passes it to this one, setting the dl dir first. Need to
get that into source control.
